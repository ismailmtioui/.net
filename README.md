This project is a RESTful white-label solution designed to implement a three-layer architecture (presentation, business logic, and data access) tailored to meet the specific needs of a given domain. The architecture ensures modularity, scalability, and maintainability, with each layer handling distinct responsibilities:

- Presentation Layer: Manages user interactions, API endpoints, and data formatting.

- Business Logic Layer: Contains domain-specific rules and processing logic to enforce business requirements.

- Data Access Layer: Handles communication with the database or external data sources, ensuring data persistence and retrieval.

This approach allows for easy customization and integration across different environments while maintaining a clear separation of concerns.
